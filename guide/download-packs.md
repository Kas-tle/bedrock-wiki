To get the most out of the guide, you should always attempt all guide-exercises yourself! However if you get very stuck, the example packs should give you some valuable reference material.

Download here: 
 - <a href="assets/packs/guide_RP.zip?raw=true">Resource Pack Download</a>
 - <a href="zips/guide_BP.zip?raw=true">Behavior Pack Download</a>.

To install, simply unzip the behavior pack into the Minecraft folder: `com.mojang\development_behavior_packs` or `com.mojang\development_resource_packs`, depending on which pack you downloaded.
